# imperium
The Decentralized Angel Investor Bitcoin Exchange: Innovating DeFi, angel investing, and DAO with fair voting, secure blockchain, smart contracts, and AI to reshape the future of decentralized finance.

To Run the Project, You can git clone and run as a Normal Flask App.

- source imperium/bin/Activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- export FLASK_APP=app.py
- export FLASK_DEBUG=1
- flask run

- The App should run on localhost:5000

- You can Sign up for an account, Sign in, Generate a Bitcoin Wallet, Create Projects, Vote on Projects, Change Settings

- The online Version is a more limited version as I encountered build issues on Heroku. https://imperium-556f4579f620.herokuapp.com/
